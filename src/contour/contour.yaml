# Key Bindings
# ------------
#
# In this section you can customize key bindings.
# Each array element in `input_mapping` represents one key binding,
# whereas `mods` represents an array of keyboard modifiers that must be pressed - as well as
# the `key` or `mouse` -  in order to activate the corresponding action,
#
# `key` represents keys on your keyboard, and `mouse` represents buttons
# as well as the scroll wheel.
#
# Modifiers:
# - Alt
# - Control
# - Shift
# - Meta (this is the Windows key on Windows OS, and the Command key on OS/X, and Meta on anything else)
#
# Keys can be expressed case-insensitively symbolic:
#   APOSTROPHE, ADD, BACKSLASH, COMMA, DECIMAL, DIVIDE, EQUAL, LEFT_BRACKET,
#   MINUS, MULTIPLY, PERIOD, RIGHT_BRACKET, SEMICOLON, SLASH, SUBTRACT, SPACE
#   Enter, Backspace, Tab, Escape, F1, F2, F3, F4, F5, F6, F7, F8, F9, F10, F11, F12,
#   DownArrow, LeftArrow, RightArrow, UpArrow, Insert, Delete, Home, End, PageUp, PageDown,
#   Numpad_NumLock, Numpad_Divide, Numpad_Multiply, Numpad_Subtract, Numpad_CapsLock,
#   Numpad_Add, Numpad_Decimal, Numpad_Enter, Numpad_Equal,
#   Numpad_0, Numpad_1, Numpad_2, Numpad_3, Numpad_4,
#   Numpad_5, Numpad_6, Numpad_7, Numpad_8, Numpad_9
# or in case of standard characters, just the character.
#
# Mouse buttons can be one of the following self-explanary ones:
#   Left, Middle, Right, WheelUp, WheelDown
#
# Actions:
# - CopySelection
# - DecreaseFontSize Decreases the font size by 1 pixel.
# - DecreaseOpacity  Decreases the default-background opacity by 5%.
# - IncreaseFontSize Increases the font size by 1 pixel.
# - IncreaseOpacity  Increases the default-background opacity by 5%.
# - PasteClipboard   Pastes clipboard to standard input.
# - PasteSelection   Pastes current selection to standard input.
# - ScreenshotVT     Takes a screenshot in form of VT escape sequences.
# - ScrollDown       Scrolls down by the multiplier factor.
# - ScrollOneDown    Scrolls down by exactly one line.
# - ScrollOneUp      Scrolls up by exactly one line.
# - ScrollPageDown   Scrolls a page down.
# - ScrollPageUp     Scrolls a page up.
# - ScrollToBottom   Scrolls to the bottom of the screen buffer.
# - ScrollToTop      Scrolls to the top of the screen buffer.
# - ScrollUp         Scrolls up by the multiplier factor.
# - SendChars        Writes given characters in `chars` member to the applications input.
# - ToggleFullScreen Enables/disables full screen mode.
# - WriteScreen:     Writes VT sequence in `chars` member to the screen (bypassing the application).
