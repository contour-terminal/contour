# Key Bindings
# ------------
#
# In this section you can customize key bindings.
# Each array element in `input_mapping` represents one key binding,
# whereas `mods` represents an array of keyboard modifiers that must be pressed - as well as
# the `key` or `mouse` -  in order to activate the corresponding action,
#
# Additionally one can filter input mappings based on special terminal modes using the `modes` option:
# - Alt       : The terminal is currently in alternate screen buffer, otherwise it is in primary screen buffer.
# - AppCursor : The application key cursor mode is enabled (otherwise it's normal cursor mode).
# - AppKeypad : The application keypad mode is enabled (otherwise it's the numeric keypad mode).
# - Select    : The terminal has currently an active grid cell selection (such as selected text).
#
# You can combine these modes by concatenating them via | and negate a single one
# by prefixing with ~.
#
# The `modes` option defaults to no filter at all (the input mappings always
# match based on modifier and key press / mouse event).
#
# `key` represents keys on your keyboard, and `mouse` represents buttons
# as well as the scroll wheel.
#
# Modifiers:
# - Alt
# - Control
# - Shift
# - Meta (this is the Windows key on Windows OS, and the Command key on OS/X, and Meta on anything else)
#
# Keys can be expressed case-insensitively symbolic:
#   APOSTROPHE, ADD, BACKSLASH, COMMA, DECIMAL, DIVIDE, EQUAL, LEFT_BRACKET,
#   MINUS, MULTIPLY, PERIOD, RIGHT_BRACKET, SEMICOLON, SLASH, SUBTRACT, SPACE
#   Enter, Backspace, Tab, Escape, F1, F2, F3, F4, F5, F6, F7, F8, F9, F10, F11, F12,
#   DownArrow, LeftArrow, RightArrow, UpArrow, Insert, Delete, Home, End, PageUp, PageDown,
#   Numpad_NumLock, Numpad_Divide, Numpad_Multiply, Numpad_Subtract, Numpad_CapsLock,
#   Numpad_Add, Numpad_Decimal, Numpad_Enter, Numpad_Equal,
#   Numpad_0, Numpad_1, Numpad_2, Numpad_3, Numpad_4,
#   Numpad_5, Numpad_6, Numpad_7, Numpad_8, Numpad_9
# or in case of standard characters, just the character.
#
# Mouse buttons can be one of the following self-explanary ones:
#   Left, Middle, Right, WheelUp, WheelDown
#
# Actions:
# - CancelSelection   Cancels currently active selection, if any.
# - ChangeProfile     Changes the profile to the given profile `name`.
# - ClearHistoryAndReset    Clears the history, performs a terminal hard reset and attempts to force a redraw of the currently running application.
# - CopyPreviousMarkRange   Copies the most recent range that is delimited by vertical line marks into clipboard.
# - CopySelection     Copies the current selection into the clipboard buffer.
# - DecreaseFontSize  Decreases the font size by 1 pixel.
# - DecreaseOpacity   Decreases the default-background opacity by 5%.
# - FollowHyperlink   Follows the hyperlink that is exposed via OSC 8 under the current cursor position.
# - IncreaseFontSize  Increases the font size by 1 pixel.
# - IncreaseOpacity   Increases the default-background opacity by 5%.
# - NewTerminal       Spawns a new terminal at the current terminals current working directory.
# - OpenConfiguration Opens the configuration file.
# - OpenFileManager   Opens the current working directory in a system file manager.
# - PasteClipboard    Pastes clipboard to standard input.
# - PasteSelection    Pastes current selection to standard input.
# - Quit              Quits the application.
# - ReloadConfig      Forces a configuration reload.
# - ResetConfig       Overwrites current configuration with builtin default configuration and loads it. Attention, all your current configuration will be lost due to overwrite!
# - ResetFontSize     Resets font size to what is configured in the config file.
# - ScreenshotVT      Takes a screenshot in form of VT escape sequences.
# - ScrollDown        Scrolls down by the multiplier factor.
# - ScrollMarkDown    Scrolls one mark down (if none present, bottom of the screen)
# - ScrollMarkUp      Scrolls one mark up
# - ScrollOneDown     Scrolls down by exactly one line.
# - ScrollOneUp       Scrolls up by exactly one line.
# - ScrollPageDown    Scrolls a page down.
# - ScrollPageUp      Scrolls a page up.
# - ScrollToBottom    Scrolls to the bottom of the screen buffer.
# - ScrollToTop       Scrolls to the top of the screen buffer.
# - ScrollUp          Scrolls up by the multiplier factor.
# - SendChars         Writes given characters in `chars` member to the applications input.
# - ToggleAllKeyMaps  Disables/enables responding to all keybinds (this keybind will be preserved when disabling all others).
# - ToggleFullScreen  Enables/disables full screen mode.
# - WriteScreen       Writes VT sequence in `chars` member to the screen (bypassing the application).
