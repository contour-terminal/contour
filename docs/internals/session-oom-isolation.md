# Session OOM isolation

An out-of-memory kill of a process running inside Contour — a compiler, a language server — must
end that process and nothing else. This page explains why that took code, and how it works.

## Why Contour died with its children

Desktops start applications as systemd units (`app-org.contourterminal.Contour@….service`).
Every process a session spawns lands in that unit's cgroup, beside Contour. Two things then
act on the unit as a whole:

- **`OOMPolicy=stop`** (systemd's `DefaultOOMPolicy`): when the kernel OOM-kills any process in
  the unit, systemd stops the whole unit — Contour and every tab.
- **systemd-oomd** kills whole cgroups under memory pressure, so a session's cgroup that contains
  Contour makes Contour a candidate.

## What happens now

`vtpty::Process::start()` forks the child and **parks** it on a gate — a socket pair — before
`exec`. The parent hands the child, as a `ParkedChild`, to the injected `ProcessPlacement`:

- `SystemdScopePlacement` (Linux, `CONTOUR_WITH_SYSTEMD=ON`) asks the user's systemd, over
  sd-bus, for a transient `contour-session-<contour pid>-<child pid>-<n>.scope` in `app.slice` with
  `OOMPolicy=continue`, waits for the job, and releases the child. Everything the child forks from
  then on is born in that scope.
  systemd before 253 knows neither `PIDFDs` nor `OOMPolicy=` on scopes and refuses a request
  carrying either, so the first such refusal switches the connection to `PIDs=` and no
  `OOMPolicy=`. Its scopes do not react to an out-of-memory kill at all, which is what we want.
- `NoPlacement` (other platforms, Flatpak, builds without systemd) releases at once.

Before parking, the child also sets the `oom_score_adj` its placement supplies -- Contour's own plus 100 -- so in a *global*
out-of-memory the kernel picks a session's process before Contour.

## Invariants worth not breaking

- **Every path releases the child.** Release is `ParkedChild`'s destructor: an exception, a
  refusal, a timeout or shutdown cannot leave a shell parked.
- **Release is a byte sent with `MSG_NOSIGNAL`.** Contour does not ignore `SIGPIPE`, and a child
  killed while parked must not take Contour with it. A byte, not end-of-file, because a sibling
  forked meanwhile inherits the gate's parent end.
- **The child waits on the gate before anything else**, using async-signal-safe calls only.
- **`placeThenRelease` never blocks and never throws**: `Process::start()` runs on the GUI thread
  and reports failures as values. One worker thread owns the sd-bus connection, and starts with the
  first session, with every signal blocked: the daemon waits for `SIGTERM` with `sigwait()`.
- **A child that exited while queued is not asked about.** Its pid may name another process by
  then; the pidfd says whether it is gone.
- **Each request listens for its own unit's `JobRemoved` only**, through a match filtered on the
  unit and removed afterwards; nothing queues up on the connection between spawns.
- **A wedged bus costs one deadline (1 s), not one per tab**: the breaker skips requests for 30 s,
  then lets one trial request decide.

## Testing

`vtpty_test "[placement]"` covers the gate, the breaker and the worker through a fake `ScopeBus`.
`vtpty_session_oom_isolation` (CTest label `systemd`) proves the requirement under a real user
manager: a driver running as a unit with `OOMPolicy=stop` must end in `oom-kill` without placement
and in `success` with it. CI runs it under a lingering user session and fails if it skipped.
