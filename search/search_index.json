That is, a single reasonably sized feature or functionality should be committed as   one single commit. If you can branch out a some functionality, let it be a more generalized API or   refactor of something that can stand on their own, then those deserve their own commits.</li> <li>Every new feature should ideally be unit-testable, this isn't always possible or easy for pure GUI   tasks, but the rest should ideally get one.

This is important because one cannot just pass a string of text to the underlying text shaping engine with mixed properties, such as Hewbrew text along with some latin and Kanji or Emoji in between or a font style change for obvious reasons. Each segment (usually called run) must be shaped individually with its own set of fallback fonts. Emoji are using a different font and font fallback list than regular text which uses a different font and font fallback list then bold, italic, or bold itaic fonts. Emoji also have two different presentation styles, the one that everybody expects and is named Emoji emoji presentation (double-width colored emoji) and the other one is named emoji text presentation, which renders emoji in (usually narrow-width) monochrome pictogram.</p> <p>The result of each sub run of a word is composing the sequence of glyph and glyph positions that can be used as the cache value of a cacheable word.

Additionally there can be a third type of texture atlas for storing LCD anti-aliased bitmap glyphs.</p> <p>Now, when rendering a string of glyphs and glyph positions, each glyph's texture atlas ID and atlas texture coordinate is appended into an atlas coordinate array along with each glyph's absolute screen coordinate and color into a vertex buffer to be uploaded to the GPU.</p> <p>When iterating over the whole screen buffer has finished, the atlas texture and vertex buffer are filled with all glyphs and related information that are reuiqred for rendering one frame.

Also grapheme cluster width computation is expensive. But luckily, in the context of terminal emulators, both can be optimized for the general case in terminal emulatoors, which is mostly US-ASCII, and yields almost no penalty with optimizations or a ~60% performance penalty when naively implemented.</p> <p>Also, implementing proper text shaping into a fixed-grid terminal wasn't really the easiest when there is no other project or text to look at. I used \"Blink's text stack\" documentation as the basis and mapped this to the terminal world. Since text shaping IS expensive, this cannot be done without caching without hurting user experience.</p> <p>After investigating into the above optimization possibilities however, I do not see why a terminal emulator should not do provide support for complex unicode, as the performance I have achieved so far is above average at least, and therefore should be sufficient for everyday use.</p> <p>Bidirectional text was not addressed in this document nor in the implementation in the Contour terminal yet, as this imposes a new set of challenges that have to be dealt with separately.
